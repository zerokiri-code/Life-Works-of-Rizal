      Design of His Home
      One of Rizal’s greatest architectural achievements in Dapitan was the design of his own home. Rizal built his house with a clear focus on simplicity and practicality, using local materials such as bamboo and nipa palm to ensure it was in harmony with the natural surroundings. The house was modest but well-planned, maximizing space while offering comfort.
      
      Inside, Rizal included features that reflected his thoughtful design approach, such as a small farm where he experimented with agricultural practices. This garden not only supplied food but also served as a learning tool for local people. The house itself became an embodiment of Rizal’s ideas on sustainable living and blending modernity with tradition.
      
      School and Community Structures
      As an architect, Rizal also designed a school for the local boys, where he imparted both academic knowledge and practical skills. The design of the school was grounded in Rizal’s belief in education that went beyond theory. He included workshops for carpentry, masonry, and farming, which helped teach the boys how to construct their own buildings and infrastructure, fostering a self-reliant community.
      
      Rizal’s influence extended beyond just physical structures; his approach to education was also architectural in its own right, as he built an environment where knowledge was applied practically. His commitment to education and civic building demonstrated how architecture and planning could support the development of a well-rounded and self-sufficient society. </p>
