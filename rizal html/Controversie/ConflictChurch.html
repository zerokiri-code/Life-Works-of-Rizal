    <h2>Conflict with the Catholic Church</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      José Rizal’s criticisms of the friars and the Church were central themes in his novels <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>. These works exposed the abuses and corruption of the religious orders, earning him the ire of the Spanish clergy. His ideas challenged the Church’s influence on Philippine society and governance.
      In Dapitan, despite his physical distance from Manila’s political scene, Rizal remained a marked man by the clergy. Jesuit priests, some of whom had been his former mentors, visited him and encouraged him to recant his writings and return to the faith. These attempts were unsuccessful. Rizal stood firm in his beliefs, refusing to retract his criticism of religious abuses unless he was given proof that the friars were acting morally.
      The conflict came to a head with his denied marriage to Josephine Bracken, which would only have been allowed had he signed a retraction. His unwavering stance deepened the tension between him and the Church, fueling the narrative that Rizal was anti Catholic though he personally stated that he believed in God and reason.
